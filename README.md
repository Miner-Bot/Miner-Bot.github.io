# MinerBot
This is the source code for MinerBot's Official Website. MinerBot is a Discord bot, whose main purpose is to entertain but can do much more.

### Who is MinerBot??
He is a Discord bot, that I (IcicleSavage) created. And that is highly expermental. I use this project as a method to learn more JS, HTML, CSS, and other languages.

### Well... what if the bot seems to be broken?
If you have a Discord account, you can DM me at IcicleSavage#0381.
Otherwise, make an issue and title it "Miner Error, on [the command that he errored on]".
